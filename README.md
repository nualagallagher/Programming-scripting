# Programming and Scripting:

# Exercises 1 & 2 are in the single file week-1&2-fibname.py


# Exercise 3 is in the file collatz-con.py
Complete the exercise discussed in the Collatz conjecture video by writing a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. At each iteration, the current value of the integer should be printed to the screen. You can specify in your code the starting value of 17. If you wish to enhance your program, have the program ask the user for the integer instead of specifying a value at the start of your code. Add the script to your GitHub repository, as per the instruction in the Assessments section. The script for Exercise 3 can be found in the file Exercise3.py.

# Exercise 4 is in the folder Exercise Project Euler Problem 5.
It is problem 5 from Project Euler. The problem is as follows. 2,520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. Write a Python program using for and range to calculate the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20. The script for Exercise 4 can be found in the folder Exercise 4.

# Exercise 5:
Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. That is, on the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns.The script for Exercise 5 can be found in the file exercise5.py.

# Exercise 6:
Write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 which equals 120. You should, in your script, test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10. The script for Exercise 6 can be found in the file exercie6.py.
